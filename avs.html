                    <p> To facilitate the browsing of long videos, automatic video
summarization provides an excerpt that represents its content.
In the case of egocentric and consumer videos, due
to their personal nature, adapting the summary to specific
user’s preferences is desirable. Current approaches to customizable
video summarization obtain the user’s preferences
prior to the summarization process. As a result, the user needs
to manually modify the summary to further meet the preferences.
In this paper, we introduce Active Video Summarization
(AVS), an interactive approach to gather the user’s
preferences while creating the summary. AVS asks questions
about the summary to update it on-line until the user is satisfied.
To minimize the interaction, the best segment to inquire
next is inferred from the previous feedback. We evaluate
AVS in the commonly used UTEgo dataset. We also
introduce a new dataset for customized video summarization
(CSumm) recorded with a Google Glass. </p> 

<p> The results
show that AVS achieves an excellent compromise between
usability and quality. In 41% of the videos, AVS is considered
the best over all tested baselines, including summaries manually
generated. Also, when looking for specific events in the
video, AVS provides an average level of satisfaction higher
than those of all other baselines after only six questions to the
user. </p>
